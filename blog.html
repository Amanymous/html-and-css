            There are many theories about us. That we’re anarchists, kids, crazy
            film-buffs that saw one too many superhero movies. The truth is, we 
            are all these things. Anonymous is a symbol, like the flag a country 
            flies. The flag is the symbol of the country. Our masks are our national 
            identity. We are not Anonymous – we represent the ideals of Anonymous. 
            Truth, freedom and the removal of censorship. Like any symbol, we affix
            it wherever we go, as you have seen from street protests.
